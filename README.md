# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

I'm Elijah (he/him) a freshman GDIM major. I really like sandbox games: Minecraft, Terraria, Kerbal Space Program. Recently, however, Ive been really immersed in Cyberpunck 2077 because I think the world building is superb. I'm taking this class because its required for my GDIM major, but also because im passionate about game dev. I've actully had a decent bit of experiance creating games: I made a demo called Voice to Move Demo and published it to the meta horizons store in order to join the oculus start program; I also do a lot of development in unity to creat content for a game called VRChat. I prefer to make game art (model and rig and all that jazz in 3D but also 2D and UI desing) but I can also enjoy coding when it complements my artistic visions. My dream is to be able to Make my own open world, but Ill have to wait for ai to improve.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

   - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media


3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I'm hoping to strengthen my skills in unity and develop connections to and work with others on the same projects with other students interested in games design. I'm most exited about the latter because I've started to hit the wall on what I can acomplish all alone.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

I'm a freshman so im still getting use to classes and the workload for the quarter system. I'm probably most worried about meeting deadlines while also balancing my physical and mental health. So far however I'm not really that worried yet.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
python - proficient
C# - proficient
C++ - I've touched it a few times (moslty as nodes in UE)

2. Game development (any engine)
Unity - proficient
Unreal Engine 5 - I've used it a little

3. Unity
fairly proficient, I've worked with most of its features such as UI creation, Importing assets both 2D and 3D, scripting objects, Animation (with rigged characters). I mostly work in 3D however. 

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
Unsure: maybe related to the plan/ outline for a game? or maybe the art/ theme guidlines for development?

2. Scope management
Preventing your ideas from going to wild and setting reasonable, achieveable goals for what you are going to make. 

3. Iteration

Creating a thing (model, script, mechanism, animation) and then remaking it but better. to give an example i did recently: I created a script for a basic climbing mechanic in vr. At first I just coded the bare bones untill it worked. following that i created a compleatly new script labeled V2 and created the script again from scratch changing the mechanic so it felt more real and accounting for issues I encounterd in the previus version.

4. Object-Oriented programming

I assume this is the whole unity thing where you have objects in a scene and they hold scripts and infromation. Im Unsure of the exact definition but as I understand it, its basicaly a programing style where you have containers of data (some of which can do things) rather than just functions. for example you have unity objects then the objects can have scripts then those scripts can have methods (not functions?)  

5. Model-View-Controller architecture
No idea
